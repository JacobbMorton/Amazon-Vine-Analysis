# Amazon-Vine-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis 
Amazon hosts a "Vine Review" service where people are paid to review products. So the validity of the review service hosted by amazon can easily be undermined if not monitored correctly. The purpose of this analysis is to look into a set of data from a department on amazon and determine the ratio of Vine reviews to Organic.

## Results
Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions:

How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?

## Summary 
In your summary, state if there is any positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. Use the results of your analysis to support your statement. Then, provide one additional analysis that you could do with the dataset to support your statement.
