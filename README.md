# Amazon-Vine-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis 
Amazon hosts a "Vine Review" service where people are paid to review products. So the validity of the review service hosted by amazon can easily be undermined if not monitored correctly. The purpose of this analysis is to look into a set of data from the software department on Amazon and determine the ratio of Vine reviews to Organic.

## Results
<img src="https://github.com/JacobbMorton/Amazon-Vine-Analysis/blob/main/Vine%20Review%20Results.png" width="600" >

- Total Paid Reviews = 248
- Total Unpaid Reviews = 17514
- Paid 5 Star Reviews = 102
- Unpaid 5 Star Reviews = 5154

- 41% of Paid Reviews were 5 Stars
- 29% of Unpaid Reviews were 5 Stars

## Summary 
When you look at the Total paid Reviews vs the total unpaid reviews, the ratio shows the paid reviews do not have mouch of an impact on the end score of the product on average. When looking at percentage of paid 5 star reviews vs unpaid 5 star reviews it is now clear that with in the vine program there is a positive bias in the software review data from Amazon. Our current analysis still cannot make a fair assesment on whether or not there is a positivity bias within the program due to the lack of analysis on the other 4 stars. With that information we could make a better determination of the programs bias.
